FAQ
===

Q. Whats different from the Speeduino code?
A. Most of the changes relate to the ini file used by tunerstudio, the injector related parameters and dialogues have been removed leaving ony the ignition parameters. The software uses a different code signature as well. There are also some additional features planned that fall outside of the current Speeduino road map.

Q. What additional features are planned?
A. I am currently looking into the following additional features:
  - Shift light
  - Water / meth injection control
